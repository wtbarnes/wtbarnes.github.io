My name is Will Barnes. I'm currently a PhD student in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University](http://www.physics.rice.edu/) where I am a member of the [Solar Physics research group.](http://solar.rice.edu/)

<br><br>

The focus of my research is the solar corona, the million-degree outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere. 

<br><br>

I'm passionate about open-source software (especially Python!) in science and scientific computing.
