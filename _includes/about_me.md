My name is Will Barnes. I'm currently a National Research Council Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. where I'm using hydrodynamic simulations and forward modeling to understand heating in the solar corona. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory in Palo Alto, California. In May of 2019, I completed my PhD in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University](http://www.physics.rice.edu/) under the direction of Dr. Stephen Bradshaw. My dissertation, *Diagnosing the Frequency of Energy Deposition in the Magnetically-Closed Solar Corona*, can be found [here](https://github.com/wtbarnes/dissertation/releases).

My primary research interest is the heating of the solar corona, the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere. In particular, I create simulations of [coronal loops](https://www.nasa.gov/content/coronal-loops-in-an-active-region-of-the-sun), huge arcs of million-degree plasma suspended high above the solar surface, to try and better understand how the coronal plasma is heated to [temperatures orders of magnitude hotter than the solar surface](https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/the-mystery-of-coronal-heating).

I'm passionate about open-source software (particularly Python!) in science and especially astronomy and solar physics. I'm involved with both the [SunPy project](http://sunpy.org/) and [OpenAstronomy](http://openastronomy.org/) which seek to promote best programming practices and openness in scientific software development. You can read more about my software projects on my [Projects page]({{ site.url }}/Projects) or check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/wtbarnes). Currently, I'm working [on a package that will provide an improved Pythonic interface to the CHIANTI atomic database](https://github.com/wtbarnes/fiasco).
