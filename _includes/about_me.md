My name is Will Barnes. I'm currently a PhD student in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University](http://www.physics.rice.edu/) where I am a member of the [Solar Physics research group](http://solar.rice.edu/).

<br><br>

The focus of my PhD research is the solar corona, the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere. In particular, I create simulations of [coronal loops](https://www.nasa.gov/content/coronal-loops-in-an-active-region-of-the-sun), huge arcs of million-degree plasma suspended high above the solar surface, to try and better understand how the coronal plasma is heated to [temperatures orders of magnitude hotter than the solar surface](https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/the-mystery-of-coronal-heating). 

<br><br>

I'm passionate about open-source software (particularly Python!) in science and especially astronomy and solar physics. I'm involved with both the [SunPy project](http://sunpy.org/) and [OpenAstronomy](http://openastronomy.org/) which seek to promote best programming practices and openness in scientific software development. You can read more about my software projects on my [Projects page]({{ site.url }}/Projects) or check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/wtbarnes). Currently, I'm working [on a package that will provide an improved Pythonic interface to the CHIANTI atomic database](https://github.com/wtbarnes/fiasco).
