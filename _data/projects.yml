  - title: fiasco
    description: High-level Python interface to the CHIANTI atomic database, a commonly used source of atomic data in solar physics. Provides many common derived quantities, including ionization equilibria and emissivities.

  - title: hissw
    description: Include and execute SSW IDL code in Python, e.g. in Jupyter notebooks, via code generation with Jinja.

  - title: synthesizAR
    description: Modular framework for forward-modeling emission from solar active regions. Time-dependent models of active regions with arbitrary geometry can be built up using any field-aligned hydrodynamic code. This project comprises the bulk of my PhD thesis.

  - title: ChiantiPy
    description: Library for parsing the CHIANTI atomic database created by Ken Dere. I've made several major contributions to ChiantiPy, including setting up the testing framework and documentation builds as well as rewriting the continuum emission module.

  - title: ebtel++
    description: Efficient hydrodynamic code for modeling dynamic evolution of coronal loops. Based on the EBTEL model of [Klimchuk et al., (2008)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...682.1351K). I am the primary author of ebtel++, but the code is maintained and hosted by the Solar Physics Group at Rice University.
