  - title: synthesizAR
    description: synthesizAR is a framework for forward-modeling emission from solar active regions. Time-dependent models of active regions with arbitrary geometry can be built up using any field-aligned hydrodynamic code. This project comprises the bulk of my PhD thesis.

  - title: ChiantiPy
    description: ChiantiPy is a library for parsing the CHIANTI atomic database started and maintained by Ken Dere. I've made several major contributions to ChiantiPy, including setting up the testing framework and documentation builds on Read the Docs as well as rewriting the module for calculating continuum emission.

  - title: ebtel++
    description: ebtel++ (or ebtelPlusPlus) is a hydrodynamic code for computing efficient, two-fluid solutions to dynamically-heated coronal loops based on the EBTEL model of [Klimchuk et al., (2008)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...682.1351K). I am the primary author of ebtel++, but the code is maintained and hosted by the Solar Physics Group at Rice University.
