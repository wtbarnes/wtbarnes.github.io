- title: ebtel++
  description: ebtel++ (or ebtelPlusPlus) is a hydrodynamic code for computing efficient, two-fluid solutions to dynamically-heated coronal loops. I am the primary author of ebtel++, but the code is maintained and hosted by the Solar Physics Group at Rice University. The Enthalpy-based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) model was originally developed by Klimchuk, Patsourakos, and Cargill.
