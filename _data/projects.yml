  - title: synthesizAR
    description: Modular framework for forward-modeling emission from solar active regions. Time-dependent models of active regions with arbitrary geometry can be built up using any field-aligned hydrodynamic code. This project comprises the bulk of my PhD thesis.

  - title: ebtel++
    description: Efficient hydrodynamic code for modeling dynamic evolution of coronal loops. Based on the EBTEL model of [Klimchuk et al., (2008)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...682.1351K). I am the primary author of ebtel++, but the code is maintained and hosted by the Solar Physics Group at Rice University.
