title: Modeling Coronal Loops in 3D with SunPy
summary: Guest post on the SunPy blog on using SunPy to model coronal loops
---
I recently wrote a blog post on [sunpy.org](http://sunpy.org/) on using the `sunpy.coordinates` module to model coronal loops. You can read the post [here](http://sunpy.org/posts/2018/2018-07-21-coronal-loop-coordinates.html) and even run an interactive version of the post in your browser.
